### Each slot saved can avoid an extra Gsset (20000 gas) for the first setting of the struct. Subsequent reads as well as writes have smaller gas savings.

### There is 1 instance of this issue:

### File: contracts/lib/OrderStructs.sol 
### @audit Variable ordering with 6 slots instead of the current 7:
### user-defined(32):order, bytes32(32):r, bytes32(32):s, bytes(32):extraSignature, uint256(32):blockNumber, uint8(1):v, uint8(1):signatureVersion
    struct Input {
        Order order;
        uint8 v;
        bytes32 r;
        bytes32 s;
        bytes extraSignature;
        SignatureVersion signatureVersion;
        uint256 blockNumber;
   }
